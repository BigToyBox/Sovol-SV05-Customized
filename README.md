# Sovol-SV05 Termite
This is my Sovol SV05 custom build project. I own a BLV MGN printer and wanted a smaller version as a second printer. I dubbed this printer "Termite".

Assembly:

## Step 1 - Vertical Extrusions
1. Follow Step 1 of the Sovol manual
    (pay attention to the note to orient the hole at the top)
2. Remove the wiring duct
    
## Step 2 - Back Wall
1. Cut a piece of 1/4"/6 mm thick material to 13 1/2" x 16"
    (I used a piece of plexiglass from the local big box store) 
2. Slide the back wall in place between the rear corner posts

## Step 3 - Corner braces
1. Install two printed corner braces at the front lower corners
2. Install two printed corner braces at the side rear corners
