# Sovol-SV05 Termite
This is my Sovol SV05 custom build project. I own a BLV MGN printer and wanted a smaller version as a second printer. I dubbed this printer "Termite".

Assembly:

## Step 1 - Vertical Extrusions
1. Follow Step 1 of the Sovol manual
    (pay attention to the note to orient the hole at the top)
2. Remove the wiring duct
    
## Step 2 - Back Wall
1. Cut a piece of 1/4"/6 mm thick material to 13 1/2" x 16"
    (I used a piece of plexiglass from the local big box store) 
2. Slide the back wall in place between the rear corner posts

## Step 3 - Corner braces
1. Install two printed corner braces at the front lower corners
2. Install two printed corner braces at the side rear corners

## Step 4 - Top Structure
1. Install the top structure following Step 2 of the Sovol manual

## Step 5 - Front Cross Bar
1. Remove the top bar with "Sovol" on the front
2. Using the printed parts, install it 70 mm above the bottom bar, inline with the top of the corner braces
3. Install the printed top corner caps

## Step 6 - Hotbed
1. Skip to Step 5 of the Sovol manual and install the hotbed braces
2. Proceed to Step 6 of the Sovol manual and install the heated bed
3. Go back to Step 4 of the Sovol manual and install the Z axis frame to the printer
4. Install the printed hotbed cable protector

## Step 7 - Electronics
1. Mount the power supply to the back wall using the three printed brackets
2. Mount the Control box to the back wall

    a. remove the control box cover
    
    b. disassemble the fan from the cover
    
    c. using the jig, drill two holes in the bottom of the control box
    
    d. Mount the control box to the back wall using the same drill jig to drill the holes in the wall
    
    e. Install the fan on the new printed cover using the fan plate and 20 mm bolts
    
    f. install the cover to the box

3. Mount the BTT pi to the back wall
    a. using the printed lower pi box as a jig, drill two holes in the wall and attach the lower box
    b. install the pi 
    c. install a fan to the printed upper cover
    d. install the pi cover to the lower box

4. Print three brackets for power supply

## Step 8 - Electrical Connections    
 1. Follow Step 9 of the Sovol manual to make all of the electrical connections
 2. Plug the BTT pi into the Sovol control box using a USB cable
 3. Connect 24v power from the control box to the pi
 4. Install two wire clamps on the right rear vertical post to hold the extruder wire loom in place. Be sure to allow enough slack when the extruder travels to the front left corner.
