# Sovol-SV05-Termite
This is my Sovol SV05 custom build project. I own a BLV MGN printer and wanted a smaller version as a second printer. I dubbed this printer "Termite".

Assembly:

Step 1 - Follow the Sovol manual
1. Install the vertical extrusions
    (pay attention to the note to orient the hole at the top)

Step 2 - Install the back wall
1. Cut a piece of 1/4"/6 mm thick material to 13 1/2" x 16"
    (I used a piece of plexiglass from the local big box store) 
2. Slide the back wall in place between the rear corner posts
